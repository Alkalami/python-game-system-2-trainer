#About it
In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman wrestles said there are two system that we used to think such as System 1 and System 2.

What Are System 1 and System 2?

System 1 and System 2 are two distinct modes of decision making:

System 1 is an automatic, fast and often unconscious way of thinking. It is autonomous and efficient, requiring little energy or attention, but is prone to biases and systematic errors.

System 2 is an effortful, slow and controlled way of thinking. It requires energy and canâ€™t work without attention but, once engaged, it has the ability to filter the instincts of System 1.

For this game, I will give you an opportunity to experience your System 2 work at full performance.
Here is how it works.
