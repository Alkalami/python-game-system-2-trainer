About it

In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman wrestles said there are two system that we used to think such as System 1 and System 2.

What Are System 1 and System 2?

System 1 and System 2 are two distinct modes of decision making:

System 1 is an automatic, fast and often unconscious way of thinking. It is autonomous and efficient, requiring little energy or attention, but is prone to biases and systematic errors.

System 2 is an effortful, slow and controlled way of thinking. It requires energy and canâ€™t work without attention but, once engaged, it has the ability to filter the instincts of System 1.
(Thank you for definition: http://upfrontanalytics.com/market-research-system-1-vs-system-2-decision-making/)
